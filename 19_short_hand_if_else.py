# (16/02/2023) today we will learn about the short hand if else condition.

# If.....else in One Line  ---> There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short.basically this is used for code readability and for short if else syntax.

# let's understand it by an example.
a = 23423
b = 3452
print("a") if a>b else print("b") 

# let's understand it by another example.
a = 456
b = 342
c = 875               # this type of method generally used for lower if else condition.
print("a") if b<a<c else print("b") if a<b<c else print("c")     

# Note: Genius coder always code for others(so that they can maintain the code by reading,writing and understanding very well) not for themselve.
