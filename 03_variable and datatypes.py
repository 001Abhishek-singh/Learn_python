# in this session we will learn about the variables and data type variables.

# variables ---> this is just like a container where we put all the stuffs(data) so that we can play or use them properly.
# data types ---> it specify the type of data(value) a variable holds.it is of various types like string,dictionary,tuple,list,int,float,boolean,complex,etc.
# Numeric data type : ---> int,float,complex
# Text data type : ---> string
# Boolean data type : ---> boolean
# Sequenced data type : ---> list,tuple
# Mapped data type : ---> dictionary

'Note: here "type" word is used to check the type of data type which is written by the user.'
'Note: in python everything is a "object" either it is tuple,list,boolean,float,etc.'


a = complex(3,4)      # here a act as complex type variable
print(a)
b = 3              # here b act as integer type variable
print(b)
c = "string" # here c act as string type variable
print(c)
d = True         # here d act as boolean type variable
print(d)
e = 34.21                # here e act as float type variable
print(e)
print(type(a),type(b),type(c),type(d),type(e))
